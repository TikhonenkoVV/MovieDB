Maybe Konstantin has enough energy to change things, but he strongly doubts that: indeed, why and for whom should he try. Nevertheless, the nature reserve is the right place to collect his thoughts, break the minefield of his own life into sections, and get to work.",

Katya does not want her daughter to be sent to an orphanage after death, and asks Lyokha to take up her head so that he becomes a guardian for an eight-year-old girl. Lyokha has already lost many close people in his life, so he does everything to help his sister: he picks up old connections and gets a job at the police station. The area turns out to be difficult. The criminals that Lyokha must catch are fairy-tale characters: the Serpent Gorynych, Baba Yaga and other evil spirits. And if the former sniper does not have problems with the capture of villains, then attempts to become a good guardian become a real test for Lyokha.",
